## Things to be used while developing
Here is a list of *recommended* coding conventions, design patterns and nuGet packages.
- **Coding conventions**:
	- Clean code. (https://medium.com/@nile.bits/clean-code-in-c-a-guide-to-writing-elegant-net-applications-db8698c8c731)
	- Layered architecture. Usage of class libraries to seperate application layers. (https://www.javatpoint.com/3-tier-architecture-in-c-sharp)
	- Data transfer objects (DTOs). (https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/data-transfer-objects-dtos-in-c-sharp/)
	- Easy to read project structure. Put `.cs` files in appropriate places by also creating extra folders if needed.

- **Design patterns**:
	- Repository pattern - used for abstracting the database layer. (https://medium.com/@kerimkkara/implementing-the-repository-pattern-in-c-and-net-5fdd91950485)
	- *May be updated*
- **nuGet packages**:
	- AutoMapper - used for easily mapping `source` object to a `destination` object. (https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/automapper-in-c-sharp/)
